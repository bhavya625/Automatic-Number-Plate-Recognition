Automatic Number Plate Recognition
----------------------------------
The project entitled “Automatic Number Plate Recognition” is mainly designed to help in recognition of number plates of vehicles. The project is based on image processing technology. It uses the popular image processing software MATLAB. While working with images in MATLAB, there are many things to be carefully taken care of like loading an image, using the right format, saving the data as different data types, how to display an image, conversion between different image formats, etc.

The image of vehicle with its number plate is given as an input to this system. The system then processes the image and identifies the number plate of the vehicle. It then matches the characters of the number plate with the templates specified and then display only the number plate of vehicle. It also maintains log file i.e., the date when image was captured.
